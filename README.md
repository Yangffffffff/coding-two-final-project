# Coding Two - Final Project  
Author: Fan Yang  

The codes are adapted from [DCGAN](https://git.arts.ac.uk/rfiebrink/ExploringMachineIntelligence_Spring2022/blob/main/week5/dcgan.ipynb) and [Fast Style Transfer for Arbitrary Styles](https://github.com/ual-cci/MSc-Coding-2/blob/master/Week-7-notebooks/tf2_arbitrary_image_stylization.ipynb)

The project chains the DCGAN model with the Fast Style Transfer model. The DCGAN model trained on MNIST generates a sequence of images and then feed into the Style Transfer model. The method was inspired by the Helena Sarin's blog post on [GANstruction](https://thegradient.pub/playing-a-game-of-ganstruction/), aims to experiment the model on simple shapes and colours to create interesting effects.
